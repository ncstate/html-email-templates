Things to Remember
----

Here are several things to keep in mind while authoring an email:

* Keep your email short and to the point
* Make sure that the email's content can also be found on your website, especially if it is a newsletter
* Generally speaking an email should just alert/point readers to content elsewhere

Inlining the CSS
----

For ease of editing, the CSS styles have not been inlined.  This is necessary before sending to ensure better email client compatibility. You can use services such as MailChimp's inliner: http://templates.mailchimp.com/resources/inline-css/
